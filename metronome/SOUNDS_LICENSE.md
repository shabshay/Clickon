# Sound Sources

All click sounds (Beep, Wood Click, Snare Click) are generated at runtime with the Web Audio API using procedural synthesis techniques (oscillators and filtered noise). No external audio files or third-party samples are bundled with this project, so there are no additional licensing requirements.
